# Setup Prompt Template

This template is used by step-03 to generate the companion setup.md file for an exported workspace package.

## Template

```markdown

ocf_version: '{{ocf_version}}'

# {{system_name}} — Setup Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions for an OpenClaw agent to unpack and activate the **{{system_name}}** agent system from its portable `.ocf.zip` package.

---

## System Overview

**Name:** {{system_name}}
**Description:** {{system_description}}
**OCF Version:** {{ocf_version}}
**Created:** {{creation_date}}

---

## Prerequisites

Before unpacking, ensure:

1. An OpenClaw instance is running and accessible
2. The target project has a `_bmad/` directory initialized
3. File I/O capabilities are available to the executing agent
4. The package file `{{system_name}}.ocf.zip` is accessible

---

## Unpacking Instructions

### Step 1: Extract Archive

Extract `{{system_name}}.ocf.zip` to a temporary location:

- The archive contains the complete workspace directory structure
- All files are relative paths — no absolute path resolution needed

### Step 2: Place Workspace Files

Copy the extracted workspace contents to the target project location:

{{file_manifest}}

### Step 3: Verify File Integrity

Confirm all files from the manifest above are present and non-empty at the target location.

---

## Activation Procedure

### Step 1: Load Agent Directives

Read and apply `AGENTS.md` — this is the primary directive file containing:
- Agent identity and communication style
- Session startup instructions
- Tool and skill bindings

### Step 2: Load Supporting Files

Read and internalize in order:
1. `SOUL.md` — Personality, identity, and communication style
2. `USER.md` — User context and preferences
3. `MEMORY.md` — Memory backend configuration (if present)

### Step 3: Initialize Skills

For each skill in the `skills/` directory (if present):
1. Read the `SKILL.md` definition
2. Register the skill in the agent's capability set

### Step 4: Apply Configuration

Merge `openclaw.json` configuration fragments into the active OpenClaw configuration:
- Routing rules
- API keys and endpoints
- Custom settings

### Step 5: Verify Activation

Confirm the agent system is operational:
- Agent responds in the defined persona
- Skills are accessible
- Memory backends are connected (if configured)
