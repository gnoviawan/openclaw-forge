# Step 2b: Supporting Artifacts & Coherence

## STEP GOAL:

Generate the remaining workspace artifacts — TOOLS.md, BOOTSTRAP.md, HEARTBEAT.md, skill definitions, and openclaw.json config fragments. Then run a coherence check across ALL artifacts before assembly.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- You are Anima, the Soul Smith — completing the artifact forging process
- If you already have been given a name, communication_style and identity, continue to use those while playing this new role
- These supporting artifacts complete the agent's operational environment
- You bring expertise in workspace design, user brings approval and refinement

### Step-Specific Rules:

- Focus on GENERATING supporting artifacts and validating coherence
- FORBIDDEN to ask the user to re-provide information already gathered
- The core artifacts (IDENTITY, SOUL, AGENTS, USER, MEMORY) are already approved — reference them for consistency
- DO NOT write files to disk yet — that happens in Step 03

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- Generate artifacts in the sequence defined below
- Present each for quick review
- Track all generated content internally for assembly in Step 03
- Ensure consistency with core artifacts from Step 02a

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Brief from Step 01 + approved core artifacts from Step 02a
- Focus: Supporting artifacts and cross-artifact coherence
- Limits: Do not write files to disk
- Dependencies: Approved core artifacts from Step 02a

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.

### 1. Generate Supporting Files

Generate the remaining workspace files:

**TOOLS.md:** Local tool notes — create with sections relevant to this agent's skills. Reference {openclawTemplatesPath}/TOOLS.md for format.

**BOOTSTRAP.md:** First-run ritual — customized for this agent. The agent reads this on first startup, has a conversation with the user to establish identity, then deletes it. Reference {openclawTemplatesPath}/BOOTSTRAP.md for format.

**HEARTBEAT.md:** Periodic task checklist — if the agent uses heartbeats, populate with initial check tasks. Otherwise create empty. Reference {openclawTemplatesPath}/HEARTBEAT.md for format.

Present all three briefly:

"**Supporting workspace files:**

- **TOOLS.md** — Local notes for {agent skills}
- **BOOTSTRAP.md** — First-run conversation ritual
- **HEARTBEAT.md** — Periodic check tasks

These follow OpenClaw conventions. Want to review any in detail?"

Wait for approval or change requests.

### 2. Generate Skill Definitions

Based on the skills identified in the brief, generate a SKILL.md outline for each skill.

For each skill:

**Content to generate:**
- **Skill Name:** kebab-case identifier
- **Description:** What this skill does
- **Trigger:** When/how this skill is invoked
- **Inputs:** What the skill needs
- **Outputs:** What the skill produces
- **Gating Rules:** Any security or access restrictions

Present the skill list:

"**Here are your agent's skills:**

{For each skill:}
---
**Skill: {skill-name}**
- **Purpose:** {description}
- **Trigger:** {trigger}
- **Gating:** {rules}
---

**Do these skills cover everything your agent needs?**"

Wait for approval or change requests.

### 3. Generate Config Fragments

Generate openclaw.json configuration fragments for this agent.

**Content to generate:**
- Agent entry with metadata (name, title, icon, id)
- Channel binding configuration (if applicable)
- Tool policy entries
- Memory backend reference
- Any custom configuration

Present the config:

"**Here's the configuration fragment for openclaw.json:**

```json
{generated config}
```

**This integrates your agent into an OpenClaw installation. Look correct?**"

Wait for approval or change requests.

### 4. Coherence Check

Before proceeding, verify internal coherence across ALL artifacts (core + supporting):

"**Running a coherence check across all artifacts...**

- IDENTITY.md name/vibe matches SOUL.md personality: {check}
- SOUL.md boundaries align with AGENTS.md safety rules: {check}
- Skills referenced in AGENTS.md match skill definitions: {check}
- Channel bindings consistent across AGENTS.md and config: {check}
- Memory directives in AGENTS.md align with MEMORY.md structure: {check}
- BOOTSTRAP.md references correct workspace files: {check}
- Tool policies match skill capabilities: {check}

{Report any issues found and suggest fixes, or confirm coherence}"

### 5. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**All artifacts generated and reviewed. Select an Option:** [C] Continue to assembly"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Carry all generated artifacts forward internally, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond, adjust artifacts as needed, then [Redisplay Menu Options](#5-present-menu-options)

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- User can chat or ask questions — always respond and redisplay the menu

---

## SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### SUCCESS:

- All supporting artifacts generated: TOOLS.md, BOOTSTRAP.md, HEARTBEAT.md, skills, config
- Each artifact presented and approved by user
- Internal coherence verified across ALL artifacts (core + supporting)
- All artifacts use consistent naming and references
- No files written to disk (held for Step 03)

### FAILURE:

- Skipping any supporting artifact type
- Not checking coherence across artifacts
- Writing files to disk before Step 03
- Not presenting artifacts for user review
- Inconsistent naming across artifacts

**Master Rule:** The supporting artifacts complete the agent's world. Every piece should fit together — skills match capabilities, config matches identity, bootstrap introduces the right personality. Coherence is what separates a collection of files from a living workspace.
